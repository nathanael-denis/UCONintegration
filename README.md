This project is an implementation of a usage control system (UCS) which interacts
with the IOTA technology. It is used to performance gains resulting from integration
in the context of micropayments in the IoT, using distributed ledgers.

To run the main, use the following commands at root i.e., where pom.xml is located:

mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="iotawucon.App" -e

The full procedure to deploy a private IOTA network on AWS, install the IOTA node (Hornet)
and to run the tests are detailed in the tutorial.pdf file.
